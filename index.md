Key Features:
- Pick colors anywhere on screen and the closest matching color name will be displayed.
- Includes a slow-mo mode for pixel accurate picking.
- Use the default colors or create your own! The app also ships with additional colors such as [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_groups.asp), [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/color/rgb/), and even [Crayola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors) colors to help you get started.
- It's fast, and (should) support every OS and editing app like Photoshop or Lightroom.
